# Face-Mask-Detection
Face mask detection systems typically use computer vision algorithms to analyze images or video footage and identify if a person is wearing a face mask or not. These algorithms work by detecting the presence of key facial features such as the mouth, nose, and chin, and analyzing the color, texture, and shape of the face mask.

Some face mask detection systems are designed to work in real-time, using cameras and sensors to detect whether people are wearing masks as they enter public spaces such as airports, shopping malls, or hospitals. Other systems are designed for use in video surveillance, analyzing recorded footage to identify instances where people are not wearing masks.

Overall, face mask detection is an important tool in helping to control the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases by encouraging people to wear masks in public spaces.
